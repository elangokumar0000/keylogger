# keylogger
A keylogger project involves creating a program that records the keystrokes typed by a user. Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious. Hereâ€™s an overview of how a keylogger project typically works, including its components, considerations, and potential use cases.


The goal of the project is to create a basic keylogger that can capture keystrokes and save them to a file. This example is intended for educational use and should not be used for unethical purposes.

To create a keylogger in Python, you'll need a few libraries:

pynput: A library for controlling and monitoring input devices.
logging: A standard Python library for logging events to files


logging.basicConfig: Configures the logging module to write logs to a file named keylog.txt. Each log entry will include a timestamp.
on_press: A function that is called whenever a key is pressed. It logs the character of the key.
on_release: This function is called when a key is released. In this example, it stops the listener if the Escape key is pressed.
keyboard.Listener: Listens for keyboard events and calls the appropriate functions.


Educational Use: Use this code only for educational purposes to understand how keyloggers work.
Legal and Ethical Issues: Unauthorized use of keyloggers to capture someone else's data without their consent is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have explicit permission before using or deploying such software.


Encryption: Encrypt the log file to protect sensitive data.
Network Transmission: Send logs to a remote server (with consent) instead of saving them locally.
GUI: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
This basic keylogger project should help you understand how keylogging works and how Python can be used for various applications. Always prioritize ethical considerations and legal compliance in your projects.
